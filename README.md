<h1> CLL121 Course Project </h1>
This repo contains input, code and output files for the CLL121 course project. 
Using this code we calculate Fugacity of CO2, Henry constant, K for water, Mole Fraction of Water for the given input values of Pressure, Temperature and Molality.
Here, I have used Newton Raphson method for the calculation of the root of the compressibility factor Z.
